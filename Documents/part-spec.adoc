= Specifications for some of the hardware parts for Simdisplay 

== LEDs
The project requires 8 LEDs for the RPM redline;
these have to be chosen carefully
so they are not too bright or too dim.

=== Elegoo LEDs
From the Elegoo Super Starter set,
I got a few blue, red, green and yellow LEDs.

* Green LED: 0.3mA - 2.3V - 10KΩ

* Red LED: ?mA - 1.8V - 

* Yellow LED: 2mA - 1.8V - 1KΩ
