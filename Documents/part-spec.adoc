== LEDs
The project requires 8 LEDs for the RPM redline;
these have to be chosen carefully
so they are not too bright or too dim.

=== Elegoo LEDs
From the Elegoo Super Starter set,
I got a few blue, red, green and yellow LEDs.

To tune the brightness, these are the values I settled on for the first prototype:

* Green LED: 1mA - 2.3V - 10KΩ

* Yellow LED: 3mA - 1.8V - 1KΩ

* Red LED: 10mA - 1.8V - 330Ω

There will be 3 green, 3 yellow and 2 slightly brighter red LEDs, arranged from left to right:

`G G G Y Y Y R R`

Where G is green, Y is yellow, R is red.

Total current will be 3 x 1 + 3 * 3 + 2 * 10 = 32mA
