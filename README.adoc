= simdisplay

A simracing dashboard created using Arduino to show shared memory telemetry from Assetto Corsa Competizione.

== Synposis

This project contains everything you need to build a real simracing dashboard that shows information from the game ACC in real time.

A Windows console process reads data from the game's shared memory and streams it to an Arduino-compatible board via the onboard USB-to-Serial connection; The board is connected to an number of LED's and a 16x2 character display and shows the relevant data, such as ABS and TC level, gear, redline RPM, etc.

The complete list of fields is documented in the relevant section of this document. 

== Hardware and Software

What makes this project interesting is that it is inexpensive and can be assembled with very limited electronics and programming skills.

The whole process will be documented with wiring and assembly diagrams as well as explanation of what the code does and the protocol used.
