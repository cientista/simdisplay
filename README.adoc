== Description

The Simdisplay project contains everything you need to build and run a real simracing dashboard
showing telemetry information from the racing simulator Assetto Corsa Competizione (ACC), in real time.

A Windows process reads data from ACC's shared memory telemetry and streams it to a supported device
running the embedded software which is also part of this project.

== Device and Service

After cloning or downloading this repository, you will find two folders: `Device` and `Service`.

=== `Device`

Under `Device/UnoR3/arduino-ide/simdisplay` you will find the Arduino IDE project file `simdisplay.ino`.

This is the embedded software that will run on the Arduino Uno R3 board microcontroller:
it receives telemetry data from the Windows host via the USB-to-serial interface
and drives all the connected LEDs and the Hitachi 16x2 dot matrix character display.

You must build and upload this software to the Arduino Uno R3, and you must connect
all the devices the board before being able to see telemetry data.

The Arduino IDE is free software and can be downloaded from `https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software`
You can compile and upload the project to your Arduino board from the avialble Web Editor without
installing the IDE on your computer if you so wish.

For more information, refer to the README.adoc file in the folder `Device/UnoR3/arduino-ide`.

=== `Service`

Under `Service/Windows/visualstudio` you will find the Visual Studio 2019 solution file `simdisplay.sln`.

This is the Windows 64-bit Console application that will run on the Windows host
where ACC is installed and runs from.
